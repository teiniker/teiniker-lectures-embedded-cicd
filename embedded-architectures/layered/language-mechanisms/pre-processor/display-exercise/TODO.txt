Exercise: Conditional Compilation - Display 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have an implementation of the Strategy pattern that can switch
between two display variants at runtime: LCD and OLED.

See: layered/design-patterns-strategy/display

Selecting variants at runtime is not sensible for an embedded system,
so adapt this example so the selection is performed by the pre-processor.


A) Common API 
Define a header file "display.h" containing the common attributes and
operations for both implementations (LCD and OLED).
Include the constructor and destructor as well.


B) Implementation Variants 
Use one source directory to implement the two variants in a single file:

    src/
        CMakeLists.txt
        display.cpp

Implement the respective attributes and operations (for I2C and
SPI) directly in the .cpp file.

Use the following macros to mark the two variants in the implementation file:
    LCD_DISPLAY
    OLED_DISPLAY


C) Build Configuration 

Configure the top-level CMakeLists.txt so that the following build
options are available:

#add_definitions(-DLCD_DISPLAY)
add_definitions(-DOLED_DISPLAY)

# Continuous Delivery for Embedded Systems

<<<<<<< HEAD
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are common development 
practices in software engineering. 

This repository demonstrates, through examples, how these techniques can also 
be applied to the development of embedded systems.

# Compiler Explorer 

Compiler Explorer is an interactive tool that lets you type code in one window 
and see the results of its compilation in another window.

By default the left hand pane is the source window and the right hand has the assembly output.


Compiler Explorer **bridges the gap between high-level programming and machine-level understanding**.
We can:
* See how C++ templates, inlining, or constexpr affect assembly.
* Learn why code runs faster (or slower) after small changes.
* Understand compiler behavior without needing a local toolchain setup.

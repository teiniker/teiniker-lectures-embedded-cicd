Exercise: Jenkins in Docker Container with C++ Build Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to setup a Docker container which contains Jenkins and the needed C++ 
build tools. The container should be started with Docker compose and accessed
via a Browser (http://localhost:8080).

The given "docker-compose.yaml" and "jenkins.yaml" files can be used without 
changes.

Complete the "Dockerfile" file:

A) C++ Build Tools 
Install the required C++ build tools.

Tip: The base image is based on Debian Linux, so we have to use the 
"apt" package manager.

B) Google Test framework
In order to build and run the test cases, we have to install the Google 
Test framework as well.

Tip: clone https://github.com/google/googletest

C) Verify 
Start the Docker container:
$ docker-compose up -d 

If we make changes to the Dockerfile we can rebuild the image:
$ docker-compose build

Finally, we access the Jenkins web GUI:

URL: http://localhost:8080/

and setup a Job to build the following projekt:

Tip: Use the "Jenkinsfile-any" file.

Exercise: Dynamic Analysis - File Access
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We build the provided "file_login.c" file using make.

When we run the binary, we need to guess the correct password for the user 
"student":

$ ./file_login 
username> student
password> student
Login rejected!

Let's try a better approach...

A) Analyze System Calls 
Attach strace to the running file_login process (use ps -a to find the PID).
Review the strace output—can you discover the access credentials?

B) Analyze Library Calls 
Start the application with ltrace.
Review the ltrace output—can you discover the access credentials?

Of course, we could simply read the "application-users.config" file, but 
let's assume a scenario where these credentials are retrieved from 
a remote server...

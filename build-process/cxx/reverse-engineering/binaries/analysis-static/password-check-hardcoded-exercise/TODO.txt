Exercise: Reverse Engineering - Hardcoded Password
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the executable named "password_check".

$ ./password_check 
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

A) Extract Password 
Use static reverse engineering techniques to extract the hardcoded password.
Try to login with the found password - only when you see the following message, 
you have extracted the right password:
    "Welcome, you have entered a valid password!"   

    TODO: Hardcoded password

B) Storage Algorithm 
Describe the algorithm which has been used to build the password:

    TODO: Description

C) Dynamic Analysis 
Use a dynamic analysis technique to retrieve the password from the 
binary.

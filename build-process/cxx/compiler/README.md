# C/C++ Compiler

The compiler is only one part of the processing chain in a C/C++ build process.  
Nevertheless, the compiler is very important and offers many configuration 
options through compiler flags.  
In particular, different levels of compiler optimization can be applied.

* [Compiler Flags](compiler-flags/README.md)

* [Compiler Optimization](compiler-optimization/README.md)


To try out these settings interactively, the online tool Compiler Explorer is 
recommended. With it, you can experiment with different compilers (including 
compiler flags) for various CPUs.

Exercise: Python Application Using BCrypt and Cryptography 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are given a Python file (password_bcrypt) that is using the BCrypt and 
Cryptography libraries.

Build a Docker image that has the following properties:
1) Use the "python:3-alpine" base image
2) Set the working directory to "/app"
3) Install the following Python libraries (using a "requirements.txt" file)
    $ pip install cryptography
    $ pip install bcrypt
4) Copy the Python source files into the working directory
5) Run the "password_bcrypt.py" script

Tip: To generate a proper "requirements.txt" file, create a virtual environment 
in your project directory, install the necessary libraries, and then export 
the dependencies to "requirements.txt".

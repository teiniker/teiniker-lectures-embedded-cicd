# gMock Framework

Google Mock (gmock) is a C++ mocking framework that integrates tightly with 
Google Test (gtest) to support **test doubles**, **behavior verification**,
and expectations in unit tests. 

While gtest handles assertions and test organization, 
**gmock focuses on mocking objects and verifying interactions**.

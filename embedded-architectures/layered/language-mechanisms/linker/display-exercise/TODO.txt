Exercise: Link-Time Polymorhism 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have an implementation of the Strategy pattern that can switch
between two display variants at runtime: LCD and OLED.

See: layered/design-patterns-strategy/display

Selecting variants at runtime is not sensible for an embedded system,
so adapt this example so the selection occurs at link time.


A) Common API 
Define a header file "display.h" containing the common attributes and
operations for both implementations (LCD and OLED).
Include the constructor and destructor as well.


B) Implementation Variants 
Use two source directories to implement the two variants:

    src-lcd/
        CMakeLists.txt
        lcd.cpp

    src-oled/
        CMakeLists.txt
        oled.cpp

Implement the respective interface attributes and operations (for I2C and
SPI) directly in the .cpp files.

Tip: Remember that the implementation files share a common header file.


C) Build Configuration 

Configure the top-level CMakeLists.txt so that the following build
options are available:

# Build with LCD Diaplay
$ cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_IMPL=LCD

# Build with OLED Display
$ cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_IMPL=OLED

# Build with LCD Display (default)
$ cmake -S . -B build 

# Build with Invalid Option
$ cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_IMPL=LED
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (message):
  Invalid value for USE_IMPL: LED.  Valid options are 'LCD' or 'OLED'.

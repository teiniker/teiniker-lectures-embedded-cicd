# Docker 

The process of **deploying a software system** and running an application 
should be **repeatable**. 

Docker is a **virtualization technology** that significantly simplifies this 
deployment process.

The basic concept behind Docker is to **run an application, and all its 
dependencies, completely isolated**, as if only your application is 
running on a server.

Exercise: Dynamic Analysis - Database Access
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise you should analyze the communication between a database server
and its client.

Start the DB server: Open a terminal and type:
$ sudo systemctl start mariadb.service

Start a command line client: Open another terminal and type:
$ mysql -u student -p
Enter password: student

MariaDB [(none)]> use testdb;
MariaDB [testdb]> source createTable.sql

A) Analyze System Calls 
Attach strace to the running client process (use ps -a to find the PID).
In the mysql client execute the following SQL statement:
    select * from User;
Analyze the strace output, what information can we get from it?

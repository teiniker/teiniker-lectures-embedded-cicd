# From Python Source Code to Execution

Python is an interpreted language, but it doesnâ€™t directly execute the source code.

When we run a Python program:
* The Python interpreter first compiles our source code into an intermediate representation called **bytecode**. 

* Bytecode is executed by the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.

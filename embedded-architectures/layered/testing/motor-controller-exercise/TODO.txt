Exercise: gMock Tests - Motor Controller
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to test a motor controller without hardware. 

Do the following steps:

A) MockCan Class

Create a file named "can_mock.h" that defines a "MockCan" class.


B) Test Cases

Analyze the "MotorController" class and implement these tests for the SUT:

- TEST(MotorControllerTest, MotorControllerSpeedUp)
    Inject the Mock object into the MotorController instance.
    The CAN message for speed provides 0 km/h.
    Then the CAN message to the motor should set power to 100%.

- TEST(MotorControllerTest, MotorControllerSpeedDown)
    Inject the Mock object into the MotorController instance.
    The CAN message for speed provides 70 km/h.
    Then the CAN message to the motor should set power to 0%.

- TEST(MotorControllerTest, MotorControllerSpeedConstant)
    Inject the Mock object into the MotorController instance.
    The CAN message for speed provides 50 km/h.
    Then no message should be sent to the motor.

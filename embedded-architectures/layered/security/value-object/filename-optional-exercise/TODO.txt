Exercise: Value Object (with std::optional) - Filename
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a Value Object named "Filename" (filename.h and filename.cpp).

A) Static Creation Method
    Implement a public static make() method that takes a filename string and
    validates it using a regular expression.
    The class constructor should be private.
    The return type of the make() method should be std::optional.

    Tip: See regex/egrep/README.md for the regular expression.

B) Accessor Method
    Implement a value() method that returns the stored filename.

C) Operator Overloading
    Ensure the following operators exist with default implementations:
    - Copy constructor
    - Assignment operator
    - Three-way (spaceship) operator for comparing Filename objects.

    Tip: Use the tests in test.cpp to verify your implementation.

# Mosquitto MQTT Broker 

**Eclipse Mosquitto** is an open source message broker that implements the 
MQTT protocol. Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices 
from low power single board computers to full servers.

The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging 
using a **publish/subscribe model**. This makes it suitable for Internet of 
Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as 
phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.



## Using Mosquitto on the Command-Line

The Mosquitto project also provides a **C library** for implementing MQTT 
clients, and the very popular **mosquitto_pub** and **mosquitto_sub** 
**command line MQTT clients**.

### Subscribing to topics

We will use the **mosquitto_sub** command-line utility included in Mosquitto 
to generate a simple MQTT client that subscribes to a topic and prints all the 
messages it receives.
```bash
$ mosquitto_sub  -t sensors/distance -d

Client (null) sending CONNECT
Client (null) received CONNACK (0)
Client (null) sending SUBSCRIBE (Mid: 1, Topic: sensors/distance, QoS: 0, Options: 0x00)
Client (null) received SUBACK
Subscribed (mid: 1): 0
```

Parameters:
* `-t`: Topic the client subscribes to
* `-d`: Debugging mode 
* `-V` mqttv311: Version number 
* `-h localhost` 

The Terminal window will display messages published to the topic to which we subscribed 
as they arrive from the MQTT server to the MQTT client.

The client sends PINGREQ packets to the MQTT server and receives PINQRESP packets 
from the MQTT server.
```bash
Client (null) sending PINGREQ
Client (null) received PINGRESP
```

### Publishing messages

We will use the **mosquitto_pub** command-line utility included in Mosquitto to 
generate a simple MQTT client that publishes a message to a topic.

```bash
$ mosquitto_pub -t sensors/distance -m  "10cm" -d
Client (null) sending CONNECT
Client (null) received CONNACK (0)
Client (null) sending PUBLISH (d0, q0, r0, m1, 'sensors/distance', ... (4 bytes))
Client (null) sending DISCONNECT
```

Parameters:
* `-t`: Topic the client subscribes to
* `-m`: Message
* `-d`: Debugging mode 
* `-V mqttv311`: Version number 
* `-h localhost` 

The previous command will create an MQTT client that will establish a connection with 
the local MQTT server and then will make the client publish a message to the topic 
specified after the `-t` option.

After publishing the message, the client disconnects.



## Setup: Debian  

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

```
$ sudo systemctl status mosquitto
mosquitto.service - Mosquitto MQTT Broker
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mosquitto.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 17:33:14 CET; 18s ago
```

Don't start Mosquitto MQTT Message Broker automatically when the Linux boots
```
$ sudo systemctl disable mosquitto
// $ sudo systemctl enable mosquitto     // default setting 

$ sudo systemctl start mosquitto
$ sudo systemctl stop mosquitto
```
The Mosquitto server will work with TCP port 1883.
Check whether the Mosquitto MQTT server is listening at the default port, 1883:
```
$ netstat -an | grep 1883
```

If we want to interact with the Mosquitto server from a different device or computer, 
we have to make sure that the firewall that is running on your computer has the 
appropriate configuration for this port number.

### Accessing the Linux VM 

In order to access the Linux VM from the local network, the network mode 
of the VM must be set to **Bridged Networking** (the default setting is NAT).

You can find out the IP address of the Linux VM with the following command:
```
$ hostname -I
192.168.0.38 
```

For example, you can access the Linux VM from the Windows host:
```
> ping 192.168.0.38

Ping wird ausgeführt für 192.168.0.38 mit 32 Bytes Daten:
Antwort von 192.168.0.38: Bytes=32 Zeit<1ms TTL=64
Antwort von 192.168.0.38: Bytes=32 Zeit<1ms TTL=64
Antwort von 192.168.0.38: Bytes=32 Zeit<1ms TTL=64
Antwort von 192.168.0.38: Bytes=32 Zeit<1ms TTL=64

Ping-Statistik für 192.168.0.38:
    Pakete: Gesendet = 4, Empfangen = 4, Verloren = 0
    (0% Verlust),
Ca. Zeitangaben in Millisek.:
    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Mittelwert = 0ms
```

An SSH connection can also be established:
```
> ssh student@192.168.0.38
student@192.168.0.38's password:
student@debian:~$
```

### Manage the Linux Firewall with Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

UFW is a user-friently, secure, and flexible firewall for Debian Linux.

First, update your APT repos and install any pending updates:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Next, we install UFW using the `apt` command:
```
$ sudo apt install ufw

$ sudo ufw version
[sudo] password for student: 
ufw 0.36.2
Copyright 2008-2023 Canonical Ltd.
```

Now, we can configure UFW to allow SSH, MQTT (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) connections:
```
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
$ sudo ufw allow 1883/tcp

$ sudo ufw allow http
$ sudo ufw allow https
$ sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
$ sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
```

We can confirm that ports are open:
```
$ sudo ufw show added
Added user rules (see 'ufw status' for running firewall):
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 443
ufw allow 1883/tcp
```

Finally, we are going to enabling UFW service in Debian 12.

Let us see the firewall status:
```
$ sudo ufw status
Status: inactive
```

Hence, enable UFW:
```
$ sudo ufw enable

$ sudo ufw status
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere                  
80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere                  
443                        ALLOW       Anywhere                  
1883/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere                  
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
1883/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6) 
```

We have successfully configured a firewall using UFW on Debian 12. 


### Enable Remote Access to Mosquitto

Starting with the release of Mosquitto version 2.0.0 the default config 
will only bind to `localhost` as a move to a more secure default posture.

```
$ sudo vi /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

# Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
#
# A full description of the configuration file is at
# /usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example

pid_file /run/mosquitto/mosquitto.pid

persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/

log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log

include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
```

In order to enable remote access for unauthorized clients, the following 
two entries must be made (this of course reduces security):

```
listener 1883 0.0.0.0   # !!! enable remote clients 
allow_anonymous true    # !!! enable clients without authentication
```

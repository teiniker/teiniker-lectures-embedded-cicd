# Yocto Project 

Yocto is a build system and framework for **creating custom, minimal Linux 
distributions for embedded systems**.

It provides tools and metadata to generate:
* A custom Linux OS image (e.g., for Raspberry Pi 5)
* A software development kit (SDK)
* Packages (e.g., .ipk, .deb, or .rpm)

Yocto uses **BitBake** (a build engine, similar to make) and metadata (recipes, 
layers, and configurations) to build everything from source, including the kernel, 
bootloader, and user-space apps.

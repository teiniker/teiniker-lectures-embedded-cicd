Exercise: Validation Proxy - CAN Interface
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have a CanInterface given (can.h) as well as a fake implementation
for this interface (can_impl.h and can_impl.cpp).

A) Proxy Pattern
Implement a CanProxy class (can_proxy.h and can_proxy.cpp) with constructor 
injection.
Each method of the CanProxy class should delegate to the implementation.

B) Validation
Implement in the method sendMessage() an input validation for the CanMessage:
- The message id must be less than or equal to 0x7FF
- The message length must be less than or equal to 8
If parameters are invalid, throw std::invalid_argument.

Tip: Use the test cases in test_proxy.cpp to verify your implementations.
